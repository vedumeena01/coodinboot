# **Game Theory Project**

## **Overview**
This project explores strategic decision-making through two **game theory** simulations:

1. **The Resource Allocation Challenge** – A bidding-based game where participants manage limited water resources efficiently.  
2. **Monopoly vs. Competition** – A market strategy game simulating competition between a monopolist and a new entrant.

These simulations apply **Nash Equilibrium, optimal bidding, and market strategy** principles to analyze rational decision-making.

## **Game 1: The Resource Allocation Challenge**  
### **Objective**
Participants act as **Water Users** (Farmers, Factories, Homes) and a **Water Manager**, competing for water resources over **three bidding rounds**. The goal is to meet water demands at the **lowest cost** while balancing bidding strategies.

### **Key Features**
- **Bidding Strategy:** Water is allocated based on highest bids, requiring optimal cost management.
- **Payoff Matrix:** Players minimize costs while ensuring adequate resource allocation.
- **Nash Equilibrium:** Players tend to settle on a **stable bidding strategy** to balance supply and cost.

## **Game 2: Monopoly vs. Competition**  
### **Objective**
A **monopolist (Firm B)** competes with a **new entrant (Firm A)** in a market setting, analyzing strategic pricing and entry decisions.

### **Key Features**
- **Firm A (New Entrant):** Decides whether to enter or stay out of the market.
- **Firm B (Monopolist):** Chooses to **accommodate** or **engage in a price war**.
- **Nash Equilibrium:** The optimal strategy suggests that Firm A **enters**, and Firm B **accommodates** to avoid losses.
